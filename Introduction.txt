# The object to process the data is to creat a model, which could be able to predict the severity of a traffic accident. 
# From the perspectives of the weather condition, time period of when was the accident happens, besides, the severity of the accidents happened in that section.
# From the given data, we can split it into traininng set and test set randomly, and use the machine learning tool learned to generate different models.
# The last step would be examine the data set and calculate the error of different models.
